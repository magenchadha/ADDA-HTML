        <br>
        <br>
        I was born in Chandigarh, a small town in north of India, however I was almost immediately brought to Dubai, United Arab Emirates by my parents. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I stayed in Dubai until I graduated high-school, then moved to New York for University. I decided to attend Barnard College of Columbia University to pursue Economics & Mathematics.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the future, I hope to gain my bachelors degree and secure a good job with my experience from various internships, externships, and involvement with my non-profit organization, Nirvana. After getting some corporate experience, I am to get a masters degree before going back to work again.
